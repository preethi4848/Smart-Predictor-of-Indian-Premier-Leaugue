# IPL-PREDICTOR FOR INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE

I have taken the IPL datset from Indian Premier League official website and it has Indian Premier League cricket data from 2008 - 2018. The purpose of this challenge is to analysis and create beautiful visualization using Tableau.

The entire visalization done in Tableau. All graphs can be found in https://github.com/preethi4848/Smart-Predictor-of-Indian-Premier-Leaugue/blob/main/IPL%20Visualization%20using%20Tableau.pdf
